The better way is that we should validate the row before it is inserted into the database.

For that in the UsersImport class need to implement WithValidation interface.

Next need to create method rules and need to declare the return type array.

And now we will return array and in this array we will specify the rules similar like we specify the rules in the controller to validate the request.

'*.email' => ['email', 'unique:users,email']
Here * means it should validate the all rows and this email is the heading name.

In the case if excel file do not have the heading so here we will use the index.
'*.1' => ['email', 'unique:users,email']

---------------------

When it caught any validation error on any row it stops there and do not insert the next rows and it also rollbacks the previously inserted rows.

So let's say it caught the validation error on the row 10th then it will stop right there and it will not insert next rows and also rollback the previously inserted rows.

Because it is using transactions and it rollbacks every previously records that is inserted when it caught the validation error.
