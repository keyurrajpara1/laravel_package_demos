Now let's say you don't want transaction here.

It should store the all the records in the database and it should skip only that row which has the validation error
so for that in the UsersImport class need to implement new interface SkipsOnFailure
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\SkipsOnFailure;


And this interface requires method onFailure and it is going to accept Failure class.
This ...$failure variable will store the validation error on single row and in this method you can handle the validation error as you want.

SkipsOnFailure - Interface
It requires onFailure method
public function onFailure(Failure ...$failure){
}


->
It also provides us SkipsFailures trait
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Concerns\SkipsFailures;

Using this trait we can access the errors in the controller.
